### October 2021

* Added `3DTILES_bounding_volume_s2` extension (draft version `0.0.0`)
* Updated 3D Metadata Specification
  * Updated to draft version `2.0.0`
  * Removed raster encoding. Storing metadata in texture channels remains a valid implementation of this specification, but is not within the scope of this document.
  * Removed table layout from the JSON encoding; each entity is encoded as a single JSON object.
* Updated 3D Metadata Semantic Reference
  * Updated to draft version `2.0.0`
  * Reorganize document to distinguish general and 3D Tiles-specific semantics
  * Added clarification for units of distance and angles
  * Added `DESCRIPTION` semantic
  * Changed `TILE_HORIZON_OCCLUSION_POINT` and `CONTENT_HORIZON_OCCLUSION_POINT` type from `ARRAY` to `VEC3`
* Updated schema definition
  * Removed `optional` and added `required`. Properties are now assumed to be optional unless `required` is true.
  * Added `noData` for specifying a sentinel value that indicates missing data
  * Removed `default`
  * `NaN` and `Infinity` are now explicitly disallowed as property values
  * Added vector and matrix types: `VEC2`, `VEC3`, `VEC4`, `MAT2`, `MAT3`, `MAT4`
  * Refactored `type` and `componentType` to avoid overlap. Properties that store a single value now have a `type` of `SINGLE` and a `componentType` of the desired type (e.g. `type: "SINGLE", componentType: "UINT8"`)
  * Class IDs, enum IDs, and property IDs must now contain only alphanumeric and underscore characters
  * Add `name` and `description` to schema, class, and enum definitions

  * Primitives and nodes may now have feature IDs without associated property tables
  * Removed string ID references to property tables and textures, replaced with integer IDs
  * Feature ID values outside the range `[0, count - 1]` now indicate "no associated feature"
  * Byte offsets for buffer views in a GLB-stored BIN chunk are no longer different from the core glTF specification
  * Renamed `_FEATURE_ID_#` to `FEATURE_ID_#`
  * Clarified that nodes with GPU instancing cannot reference property textures
  * For GPU instance metadata, the `EXT_mesh_features` extension is now scoped to the `node` extensions instead of nesting inside the `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` extension.
  * Refactored the property texture schema so it is now a glTF `textureInfo` object. All property values must be packed into a single texture.
  * Property textures are now assumed to be in linear space, and must use nearest or linear filtering

### February 2022

* Updated 3D Metadata Specification
  * Updated to draft version `3.0.0`
  * Updated schema definition. See notes below.
* Updated 3D Metadata Semantic Reference
  * Updated to draft version `3.0.0`
  * `CONTENT_*` semantics should now be assigned to content metadata properties instead of tile metadata properties
  * Added `ATTRIBUTION_IDS` and `ATTRIBUTION_STRINGS` semantics for providing data attribution at multiple levels of granularity
  * Added `TILESET_FEATURE_ID_LABELS` semantic to list the feature ID labels present in glTF content referenced by the tileset
  * Added `TILESET_CRS_GEOCENTRIC` semantic to describe the geocentric coordinate reference system of the tileset

  * Added `CONTENT_BOUNDING_S2_CELL` semantics
  * Added `CONTENT_URI` semantic
  * Added `CONTENT_GROUP_ID` semantic
* Updated schema definition
  * `type` is required and must be one of the following: `SCALAR`, `VEC2`, `VEC3`, `VEC4`, `MAT2`, `MAT3`, `MAT4`, `STRING`, `BOOLEAN`, `ENUM`
  * `componentType` is required for scalar, vector, and matrix types and must be one of the following: `INT8`, `UINT8`, `INT16`, `UINT16`, `INT32`, `UINT32`, `INT64`, `UINT64`, `FLOAT32`, `FLOAT64`
  * Arrays are now distinct from the type system
    * Removed `ARRAY` type and `componentCount` property; replaced with `array` and `count` properties. `array` is a boolean that indicates whether the property is an array. When `count` is defined the property is a fixed-length array. Otherwise the property is a variable-length array.
    * Arrays of vectors and matrices are now supported
  * Added `offset` and `scale` which are used to transform property values into a different range. Useful for quantized property values.
  * Added back `default`
  * Schema `id` property is now required
* Updated property table definition
  * Renamed `bufferView` to `values`
  * Renamed `stringOffsetBufferView` to `stringOffsets`
  * Renamed `arrayOffsetBufferView` to `arrayOffsets`
  * Added `offset` and `scale` which are used to transform property values into a different range. When present, these override the class property's `offset` and `scale`.
  * Added `min` and `max` which store the minimum and maximum property values.
* Updated `3DTILES_metadata` extension
  * Updated to draft version `3.0.0`
  * Updated schema definition. See notes above.
  * Added content metadata. A content may specify its class and property values with the `3DTILES_metadata` content extension object.
  * Removed the implicit tiling `3DTILES_metadata` extension. Tile metadata is now provided by the `tileMetadata` subtree property.
  * The `groups` that are defined in a tileset are now given as an array. Each group has a unique identifier.
* Updated `3DTILES_implicit_tiling` extension
  * Updated to draft version `2.0.0`
  * Updated property table definition. See notes above.
  * Changed `maximumLevel` to `availableLevels` for consistency with `subtreeLevels`. Note that `maximumLevel` is an index whereas `availableLevels` is a length: `availableLevels` is equivalent to `maximumLevel + 1`.
  * Content availability for multiple contents is now provided by the `contentAvailability` property instead of a separate `3DTILES_multiple_contents` extension. `contentAvailability` is now an array of availability objects.
  * Added top-level `propertyTables` array to subtree format.
  * Tile metadata is now provided by the `tileMetadata` property instead of a separate `3DTILES_metadata` extension. `tileMetadata` refers to a property table containing metadata about available tiles.
  * Content metadata is now provided by the `contentMetadata` property. Each array element refers to a property table containing metadata about available content.
  * Subtree metadata is now provided by the `subtreeMetadata` object. Subtree metadata is encoded in JSON, similar to tileset metadata.
  * Renamed availability `bufferView` to `bitstream`
  * Added JSON subtree format as an alternative to the binary subtree format
* Updated `3DTILES_multiple_contents` extension
  * Updated to draft version `1.0.0`
  * Renamed `content` to `contents`
  * Removed the implicit tiling `3DTILES_multiple_contents` extension. Content availability for multiple contents is now provided by the `contentAvailability` subtree property.
* Split the `EXT_mesh_features` extension into three separate extensions:
  * `EXT_mesh_features` that only defines the concept of feature IDs
  * `EXT_structural_metadata` that allows associating the features with metadata
  * `EXT_instance_features` that supports GPU instance feature IDs.
* Updated `EXT_mesh_features` extension
  * Updated to draft version `3.0.0`
  * Removed the "Implicit Feature IDs" concept. There have not been enough practical use-cases that could justify including them.
  * Renamed `FEATURE_ID_#` back to `_FEATURE_ID_#`: The underscore is required for custom attributes, according to the glTF specification, and without it, the assets do not pass validation.
  * The `featureIds` and the `propertyTables` had been stored as parallel arrays, and the connection between them had been established _implicitly_, by them appearing at the same index in their respective array. Now each feature ID set can _explicitly_ contain `propertyTable`, which is the index of the property table that it refers to.
  * Added optional `label` property to identify feature ID sets across different glTF primitives and assets.
  * Instead of having dedicated classes for "Attribute Feature IDs" and "Texture Feature IDs", there is one common "Feature ID" class that either stores the `attribute` or the `texture`, respectively.
  * Added `featureId.nullFeatureId`, which can be used as a value indicating that a certain element is not associated with a feature ID.
  * Added `featureId.featureCount`, which is the number of distinct, non-`null` feature ID values.
  * Changed the `channel` for feature ID textures to be a `channels` array, so that multiple channels can be combined into one feature ID, allowing for more than 256 feature ID values in feature ID textures.
* Added `EXT_structural_metadata` extension (draft version `0.0.0`)
  * Updated property table definition. See notes above.
  * Update schema definition. See notes above.
  * Updated property texture definition
    * Properties are no longer required to be packed into the same texture. The number of class properties is no longer constrained by the number of texture channels.
    * Each item in the `properties` dictionary is now a `textureInfo` object
    * Added `offset` and `scale` which are used to transform property values into a different range. When present, these override the class property's `offset` and `scale`.
    * Added `min` and `max` which store the minimum and maximum property values in the texture.
  * Added `propertyAttributes`, and additional metadata encoding for vertex data, in particular point clouds
* Added `EXT_instance_features` extension (draft version `0.0.0`)
