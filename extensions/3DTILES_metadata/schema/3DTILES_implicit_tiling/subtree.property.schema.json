When `componentType` is `STRING` values are stored as byte sequences and decoded as UTF-8 strings. When `componentType` is a numeric type values are stored as the provided `componentType`. When `componentType` is `ENUM` values are stored as the enum's `valueType`. Each enum value in the buffer must match one of the allowed values in the enum definition. When `type` is `ARRAY` elements are packed tightly together and the data type is based on the `componentType` following the same rules as above. `arrayOffsetBufferView` is required for variable-size arrays and `stringOffsetBufferView` is required for strings (for variable-length arrays of strings, both are required).
