A tile's availability is determined by a single bit, 1 meaning a tile exists at that spatial index, and 0 meaning it does not.

Availability may be stored in a bufferView or as a constant value that applies to all tiles. If a non-root tile's availability is 1 its parent tile's availability must also be 1. `tileAvailability.constant: 0` is disallowed, as subtrees must have at least one tile."
