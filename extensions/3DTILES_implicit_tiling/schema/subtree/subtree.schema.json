The availability bitstream is a 1D boolean array where tiles are ordered by their level in the subtree and Morton index within that level. A tile's availability is determined by a single bit, 1 meaning a tile exists at that spatial index, and 0 meaning it does not. The number of elements in the array is `(N^subtreeLevels - 1)/(N - 1)` where N is 4 for subdivision scheme `QUADTREE` and 8 for `OCTREE`. Availability may be stored in a bufferView or as a constant value that applies to all tiles. If a non-root tile's availability is 1 its parent tile's availability must also be 1. `tileAvailability.constant: 0` is disallowed, as subtrees must have at least one tile."
