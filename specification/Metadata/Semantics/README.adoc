[#metadata-semantics-overview]
[discrete]
== Overview

This document provides common definitions of meaning ("semantics") used by metadata properties in 3D Tiles and glTF. Tileset authors may define their own application- or domain-specific semantics separately.

Semantics describe how properties should be interpreted. For example, an application that encounters the `ID` or `NAME` semantics while parsing a dataset may use these values as unique identifiers or human-readable labels, respectively.

Each semantic is defined in terms of its meaning, and the datatypes it may assume. Datatype specifications include "type" as defined by the xref:{url-specification-metadata}README.adoc#metadata-3d-metadata-specification[3D Metadata Specification]. When applicable they may also include "component type", "array", and "count".

For use of semantics, see:

=== Overview

Throughout this section, the term "entity" refers to any conceptual object with which a property value (as defined in the xref:{url-specification-metadata}README.adoc#metadata-3d-metadata-specification[3D Metadata Specification]) may be associated. Examples of entities include tilesets, tiles, and tile contents in 3D Tiles, or groups of vertices and texels in glTF 2.0 assets. Additional types of entities may be defined by other specifications or applications.

[cols="1,1a,2"]
|===
| Semantic | Type | Description

| `ID`
| - Type: `STRING`
| The unique identifier for the entity.

| `NAME`
| * Type: `STRING`
| The name of the entity. Names should be human-readable, and do not have to be unique.

| `DESCRIPTION`
| * Type: `STRING`
| Description of the entity. Typically at least a phrase, and possibly several sentences or paragraphs.

| `ATTRIBUTION_IDS`
| 
* Type: `SCALAR`
* Component type: `UINT8`, `UINT16`, `UINT32`, or `UINT64`
* Array: `true`
| List of attribution IDs that index into a global list of attribution strings. This semantic may be assigned to metadata at any level of granularity including tileset, group, subtree, tile, content, feature, vertex, and texel granularity. The global list of attribution strings is located in a tileset or subtree with the property semantic `ATTRIBUTION_STRINGS`. The following precedence order is used to locate the attribution strings: first the containing subtree (if applicable), then the containing external tileset (if applicable), and finally the root tileset.

| `ATTRIBUTION_STRINGS`
| 
* Type: `STRING`
* Array: `true`
| List of attribution strings. Each string contains information about a data provider or copyright text. Text may include embedded markup languages such as HTML. This semantic may be assigned to metadata at any granularity (wherever `STRING` property values can be encoded). When used in combination with `ATTRIBUTION_IDS` it is assigned to subtrees and tilesets.

[discrete]
=== Overview

Semantics for 3D Tiles are assigned in relationship to a tileset, subtree, tile, or tile content, as defined by the 3D Tiles specification. When associated with other types of entities, these semantics may have invalid or undefined meanings.

Units for all linear distances are meters, and all angles are radians.

|===
| Semantic | Type | Description

| `TILESET_FEATURE_ID_LABELS`
| 
* Type: `STRING`
* Array: `true`
| The union of all the feature ID labels in glTF content using the https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_features[`EXT_mesh_features`] and https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_instance_features[`EXT_instance_features`] extensions.

| `TILESET_CRS_GEOCENTRIC`
| * Type: `STRING`
| 
The geocentric coordinate reference system (CRS) of the tileset. Values include, but are not limited to:

* ``"EPSG:4978"`` - WGS 84
* ``"EPSG:7656"`` - WGS 84 (G730)
* ``"EPSG:7658"`` - WGS 84 (G873)
* ``"EPSG:7660"`` - WGS 84 (G1150)
* ``"EPSG:7662"`` - WGS 84 (G1674)
* ``"EPSG:7664"`` - WGS 84 (G1762)
* ``"EPSG:9753"`` - WGS 84 (G2139)
* ``"UNKNOWN"`` - CRS is unknown

``region`` bounding volumes are assumed to use the same reference ellipsoid as the geocentric coordinate reference system specified here.

For more details on coordinate reference systems in 3D Tiles, see xref:{url-specification}README.adoc#core-coordinate-reference-system-crs[Coordinate Reference System (CRS)].

| `TILESET_CRS_COORDINATE_EPOCH`
| - Type: `STRING`
| The coordinate epoch for coordinates that are referenced to a dynamic CRS such as WGS 84. Coordinates include glTF vertex positions after transforms have been applied -- see xref:{url-specification}README.adoc#core-gltf-transforms[glTF transforms]. Expressed as a decimal year (e.g. `"2019.81"`). See http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/18-010r7/18-010r7.html#128[WKT representation of coordinate epoch and coordinate metadata] for more details.

=== Tile

[#metadata-semantics-overview-4]
[discrete]
==== Overview

`TILE_*` semantics provide meaning for properties associated with a particular tile, and should take precedence over equivalent metadata on parent objects, as well as over values derived from subdivision schemes in xref:{url-specification-implicittiling}README.adoc#implicittiling-implicit-tiling[Implicit Tiling].

If property values are missing, either because the property is omitted or the property table contains `noData` values, the original tile properties are used, such as those explicitly defined in tileset JSON or implicitly computed from subdivision schemes in xref:{url-specification-implicittiling}README.adoc#implicittiling-implicit-tiling[Implicit Tiling].

In particular, `TILE_BOUNDING_BOX`, `TILE_BOUNDING_REGION`, and `TILE_BOUNDING_SPHERE` semantics each define a more specific bounding volume for a tile than is implicitly calculated from xref:{url-specification-implicittiling}README.adoc#implicittiling-implicit-tiling[Implicit Tiling]. If more than one of these semantics are available for a tile, clients may select the most appropriate option based on use case and performance requirements.
