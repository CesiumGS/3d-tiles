The xref:{url-specification-metadata}README.adoc#metadata-3d-metadata-specification[3D Metadata Specification] defines xref:{url-specification-metadata}README.adoc#metadata-schemas[schemas] as a description of the structure of metadata, consisting of classes with different properties, and enum types. The following is the description of a JSON-based representation of such a schema and its elements. It is used as the basis for defining the metadata structure in the following implementations:

* xref:{url-specification-implicittiling}README.adoc#implicittiling-timplicit-tiling[3D Tiles Metadata Implicit Tilesets] - Assigns metadata to tilesets, tiles, groups, and contents in a 3D Tiles tileset. A property table is defined for subtrees of an implicit tile hierarchy, and stores metadata that is associated with the nodes of such a subtree.
* https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_structural_metadata[`EXT_structural_metadata`] -- Assigns metadata to vertices, texels, and features in a glTF asset. A property table is defined in the top-level extension object. The property values are stored in standard glTF buffer views.

The full JSON schema definition for this implementation can be found in link:../../../schema/Schema/[the Schema directory of the specification].

[#metadata-referenceimplementation-schema-schema]
== Schema

_Defined in link:https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/tree/draft-1.1/specification/schema/Schema/schema.schema.json[schema.schema.json]._

A schema defines a set of classes and enums. Classes serve as templates for entities. They provide a list of properties and the type information for those properties. Enums define the allowable values for enum properties.

[NOTE]
.Example
====
Schema with a `tree` class, and a `speciesEnum` enum that defines different species of trees. Later examples show how these structures in more detail.

[#metadata-referenceimplementation-schema-class]
=== Class

_Defined in link:https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/tree/draft-1.1/specification/schema/Schema/class.schema.json[class.schema.json]._

A class is a template for metadata entities. Classes provide a list of property definitions. Every entity must be associated with a class, and the entity's properties must conform to the class's property definitions. Entities whose properties conform to a class are considered instances of that class.

Classes are defined as entries in the `schema.classes` dictionary, indexed by class ID. Class IDs must be xref:{url-specification-metadata}README.adoc#metadata-identifiers[identifiers] as defined in the 3D Metadata Specification.

[NOTE]
.Example
====
A "Tree" class, which might describe a table of tree measurements taken in a park. Property definitions are abbreviated here, and introduced in the next section.

=== Class Property

_Defined in link:https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/tree/draft-1.1/specification/schema/Schema/class.property.schema.json[class.property.schema.json]._

Class properties are defined abstractly in a class. The class is instantiated with specific values conforming to these properties. Class properties support a rich variety of data types. Details about the supported types can be found in the xref:{url-specification-metadata}README.adoc#metadata-property[3D Metadata Specification].

Class properties are defined as entries in the `class.properties` dictionary, indexed by property ID. Property IDs must be xref:{url-specification-metadata}README.adoc#metadata-identifiers[identifiers] as defined in the 3D Metadata Specification.

[NOTE]
.Example
====
A "Tree" class, which might describe a table of tree measurements taken in a park. Properties include species, age, height, and diameter of each tree.

[#metadata-referenceimplementation-schema-enum]
=== Enum

_Defined in link:https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/tree/draft-1.1/specification/schema/Schema/enum.schema.json[enum.schema.json]._

A set of categorical types, defined as `(name, value)` pairs. Enum properties use an enum as their type.

Enums are defined as entries in the `schema.enums` dictionary, indexed by an enum ID. Enum IDs must be xref:{url-specification-metadata}README.adoc#metadata-identifiers[identifiers] as defined in the 3D Metadata Specification.

[NOTE]
.Example
====
A "Species" enum defining types of trees. An "Unspecified" enum value is optional, but when provided as the `noData` value for a property (see: xref:{url-specification-metadata}README.adoc#metadata-required-properties-no-data-values-and-default-values[3D Metadata - No Data Values]) may be helpful to identify missing data.

[#metadata-referenceimplementation-schema-enum-value]
=== Enum Value

_Defined in link:https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/tree/draft-1.1/specification/schema/Schema/enum.value.schema.json[enum.value.schema.json]._

Pairs of `(name, value)` entries representing possible values of an enum property.

Enum values are defined as entries in the `enum.values` array. Duplicate names or duplicate integer values are not allowed.
