3D Tiles is designed for streaming and rendering massive 3D geospatial content such as Photogrammetry, 3D Buildings, BIM/CAD, Instanced Features, and Point Clouds. It defines a hierarchical data structure and a set of tile formats which deliver renderable content. 3D Tiles does not define explicit rules for visualization of the content; a client may visualize 3D Tiles data however it sees fit.
