[#tileformats-gltf-overview]
== Overview

https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF[glTF 2.0] is the primary tile format for 3D Tiles. glTF is an open specification designed for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D content. A glTF asset includes geometry and texture information for a single tile, and may be extended to include metadata, model instancing, and compression. glTF may be used for a wide variety of 3D content including:

* Heterogeneous 3D models. E.g. textured terrain and surfaces, 3D building exteriors and interiors, massive models
* Massive point clouds
* 3D model instances. E.g. trees, windmills, bolts

[#tileformats-gltf-use-cases]
== Use Cases

[#tileformats-gltf-3d-models]
=== 3D Models

glTF provides flexibilty for a wide range of mesh and material configurations, and is well suited for photogrammetry as well as stylized 3D models.

[#tileformats-gltf-point-clouds]
=== Point Clouds

glTF supports point clouds with the `0` (`POINTS`) primitive mode. Points can have positions, colors, normals, and custom attributes as specified in the `primitive.attributes` field.

When using the https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_features[`EXT_mesh_features`] extension points can be assigned feature IDs and these features can have associated metadata.

[#tileformats-gltf-instancing]
=== Instancing

glTF can leverage GPU instancing with the https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing/README.md[`EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing`] extension. Instances can be given unique translations, rotations, scales, and other per-instance attributes.

When using the https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_instance_features[`EXT_instance_features`] extension instances can be assigned feature IDs and these features can have associated metadata.

[#tileformats-gltf-feature-identification]
== Feature Identification

https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_features[`EXT_mesh_features`] provides a means of assigning identifiers to geometry and subcomponents of geometry within a glTF 2.0 asset. Feature IDs can de assigned to vertices or texels. https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_instance_features[`EXT_instance_features`] allows feature IDs to be assigned to individial instances.

Right: classification is used to determine rendering material properties, e.g., make the windows translucent._

[#tileformats-gltf-metadata]
== Metadata

https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_structural_metadata[`EXT_structural_metadata`] stores metadata at per-vertex, per-texel, and per-feature granularity and uses the type system defined in the link:../../Metadata[3D Metadata Specification]. This metadata can be used for visualization and analysis.

[#tileformats-gltf-compression]
== Compression

glTF has several extensions for geometry and texture compression. These extensions can help reduce file sizes and GPU memory usage.

[#tileformats-gltf-geometry-compression]
=== Geometry Compression

* https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_mesh_quantization[KHR_mesh_quantization]
* https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_meshopt_compression[EXT_meshopt_compression]
* https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_draco_mesh_compression[KHR_draco_mesh_compression]

[#tileformats-gltf-texture-compression]
=== Texture Compression

* https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_texture_basisu[KHR_texture_basisu]

[#tileformats-gltf-file-extensions-and-media-types]
== File Extensions and Media Types

See https://www.khronos.org/registry/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#file-extensions-and-media-types[glTF File Extensions and Media Types].

An explicit file extension is optional. Valid implementations may ignore it and identify a content's format through other means, such as the `magic` field in the binary glTF header or the presence of an `asset` field in JSON glTF.
