= Migration From Legacy Tile Formats

This section describes how legacy tile formats can be converted into equivalent glTF content.

[#tileformats-gltf-batched-3d-model-b3dm]
[discrete]
== Batched 3D Model (b3dm)

link:../Batched3DModel[Batched 3D Model] is a wrapper around a binary glTF that includes additional information in its Feature Table and Batch Table. Batched 3D Model content can be converted into glTF content with the following changes:

* The https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/tree/main/specification/TileFormats/Batched3DModel#coordinate-system[`RTC_CENTER`] can be added to the translation component of the root node of the glTF asset.
* Batch IDs and Batch Tables can be represented using https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_features[`EXT_mesh_features`] and https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_structural_metadata[`EXT_structural_metadata`].

[#tileformats-gltf-instanced-3d-model-i3dm]
[discrete]
== Instanced 3D Model (i3dm)

link:../Instanced3DModel[Instanced 3D Model] instances a glTF asset (embedded or external) and provides per-instance transforms and batch IDs.

* The `RTC_CENTER` can be added to the translation component of the root node of the glTF asset.
* glTF can leverage GPU instancing with the https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing/README.md[EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing] extension.
* Batch IDs and Batch Tables can be represented using https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_instance_features[`EXT_instance_features`] and https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_structural_metadata[`EXT_structural_metadata`].
* `EAST_NORTH_UP` is not directly supported, but can be represented using per-instance rotations.

[#tileformats-gltf-point-cloud-pnts]
[discrete]
== Point Cloud (pnts)

link:../PointCloud[Point Cloud] can be represented as a glTF using the primitive mode `0` (`POINTS`).

* The `RTC_CENTER` can be added to the translation component of the root node of the glTF asset.
* Feature table properties like `POSITION`, `COLOR`, and `NORMAL` may be stored as glTF attributes.
* https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_meshopt_compression[`EXT_meshopt_compression`] and https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_mesh_quantization[`KHR_mesh_quantization`] may be used for point cloud compression. link:../../../extensions/3DTILES_draco_point_compression/[`3DTILES_draco_point_compression`] is not directly supported in glTF because https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_draco_mesh_compression[`KHR_draco_mesh_compression`] only supports triangle meshes.
* Batch IDs and Batch Tables can be represented using https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_features[`EXT_mesh_features`] and https://github.com/CesiumGS/glTF/tree/3d-tiles-next/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_structural_metadata[`EXT_structural_metadata`].
* `CONSTANT_RGBA` is not directly supported in glTF, but can be achieved with materials or per-point colors.

[#tileformats-gltf-composite-cmpt]
[discrete]
== Composite (cmpt)

All inner contents of a link:../Composite[Composite] may be combined into the same glTF as separate nodes, meshes, or primitives, at the tileset author's discretion. Alternatively, a tile may have link:../../README.md#tile-content[multiple contents].
